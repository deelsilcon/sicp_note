## SICP_NOTE
This project contains my reading notes of SICP. I also solved some of the exercises in the book on my own.
Each of the following folders contains the source code and notes for the relevant chapter.
### Environment
I use [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/) for my scheme coding and debugging. Please note that you should install
**sicp** package in DrRacket so as to get the same programming environment as in the book. Then add `#lang sicp` at the
very beginning of each scheme file.
