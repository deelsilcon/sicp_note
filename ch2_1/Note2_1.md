## Data Abstraction

### Key Conception

1. Data abstraction enables us to erect suitable ***abstraction barriers*** between different parts of programs.
2. ***Closure***: We can combine not only primitive data objects, but compound data objects as well.
3. Compound data objects can serve as ***conventional interfaces*** for combining program modules in mix-and match ways.
